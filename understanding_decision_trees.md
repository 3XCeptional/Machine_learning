# Understanding Decision Trees: A Deep Dive

## What are Decision Trees?

[Explain Decision Trees in detail, expanding on the basic definition from "What are the 10 Popular Machine Learning Algorithms?" file.]

## How Decision Trees Work

Decision trees work by recursively partitioning the feature space based on feature values. The partitioning process differs slightly for classification and regression trees. Let's start with classification trees:

### Decision Trees for Classification

**Classification Trees** are used when the target variable is categorical, and the goal is to classify data points into distinct classes. They build a tree structure to represent decision rules that lead to class predictions. Here's how they work:

1.  **Recursive Partitioning:** The algorithm starts with the entire training dataset at the root node. It then recursively splits the data based on feature tests at each internal node.
2.  **Feature Selection and Splitting Criteria:** At each internal node, the algorithm selects the "best" feature to split the data. "Best" is determined by a splitting criterion that aims to maximize the **separation of classes** in the child nodes. Common splitting criteria for classification trees include:
    *   **Entropy and Information Gain:** Aim to reduce entropy (impurity) in the class distribution of the child nodes.
    *   **Gini Impurity:** Measures the impurity of a node based on the class distribution.
    *   **Chi-Square Statistic:** Uses statistical significance tests to determine the best split.
    The algorithm evaluates different features and split points for each feature and chooses the one that optimizes the chosen splitting criterion.
3.  **Node Splitting:** Once the best feature and split point are chosen, the current node is split into two or more child nodes, each corresponding to a branch based on the possible outcomes of the feature test. The data is partitioned and distributed to these child nodes based on whether they satisfy the split condition.
4.  **Stopping Criteria (Tree Growth):** The recursive partitioning process continues until a stopping criterion is met. Common stopping criteria include:
    *   **Purity:** When all (or most) data points in a node belong to the same class (node becomes "pure").
    *   **Minimum Samples per Leaf:** When the number of data points in a node falls below a certain minimum threshold.
    *   **Maximum Tree Depth:** When the tree reaches a predefined maximum depth.
    *   **No Further Improvement:** When further splitting does not significantly improve the splitting criterion.
5.  **Leaf Node Assignment:** When a stopping criterion is met, a node becomes a **leaf node**. Each leaf node is assigned a **class label**. For classification trees, the class label is typically determined by the **majority class** of the training samples that end up in that leaf node.

**In essence, classification trees work by recursively partitioning the feature space to create regions that are as pure as possible in terms of class labels.** The splitting decisions are made greedily at each node to maximize class separation based on the chosen splitting criterion. The tree structure represents a hierarchy of decision rules that can be easily interpreted and visualized.
