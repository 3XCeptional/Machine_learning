# Understanding Decision Trees: A Deep Dive

## What are Decision Trees?

[Explain Decision Trees in detail, expanding on the basic definition from "What are the 10 Popular Machine Learning Algorithms?" file.]

## How Decision Trees Work

### Decision Trees for Classification

[Explain how Decision Trees work for classification tasks, including the tree structure and decision-making process.]

### Decision Trees for Regression

[Explain how Decision Trees work for regression tasks, highlighting the differences from classification trees.]

## Splitting Criteria in Decision Trees

[Explain different splitting criteria used in Decision Trees for node splitting:]

### Entropy and Information Gain (for Classification)

[Explain Entropy and Information Gain and how they are used to choose splits in classification trees.]

### Gini Impurity (for Classification)

[Explain Gini Impurity as an alternative splitting criterion for classification trees.]

### Mean Squared Error (MSE) and other Regression Criteria (for Regression)

[Briefly explain MSE and other criteria used for splitting nodes in regression trees.]

## Tree Pruning Techniques

[Explain the importance of tree pruning to prevent overfitting and discuss common pruning techniques:]

### Pre-Pruning (Early Stopping)

[Explain Pre-pruning techniques like limiting tree depth, minimum samples per leaf, etc.]

### Post-Pruning (Cost Complexity Pruning)

[Explain Post-pruning techniques like Cost Complexity Pruning (CCP) and how they work.]

## Handling Categorical and Numerical Features

[Explain how Decision Trees handle both categorical and numerical features.]

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Decision Trees

[Summarize the pros and cons of using Decision Tree algorithm.]

## Implementation and Examples

[Provide Python code examples using scikit-learn to implement Decision Trees for classification and regression. Potentially link to or incorporate content from `intro to Machine Learning/DecisionTree_and_ DecisionTreeRegressor.md`.]
