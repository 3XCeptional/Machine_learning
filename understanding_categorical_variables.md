# Understanding Categorical Variables

## What are Categorical Variables?

In the world of data, variables can be broadly classified into two main types: **categorical** and **numerical**.  Categorical variables, as the name suggests, represent categories or groups. Instead of measuring quantities, they describe qualities or characteristics. Think of them as labels that tell you which group a data point belongs to.

**Key Differences from Numerical Variables:**

*   **Numerical variables** represent quantities and can be measured (e.g., height, weight, temperature). They can be continuous (taking any value within a range) or discrete (taking only specific values, often integers).
*   **Categorical variables**, on the other hand, represent qualities or attributes. They are not measured in the same way as numerical variables. You can't perform arithmetic operations (like addition or subtraction) on categories in a meaningful way. For example, it doesn't make sense to "add" the category "red" to the category "blue."

**Examples of Categorical Variables:**

*   **Color:** (e.g., red, blue, green)
*   **Type of Fruit:** (e.g., apple, banana, orange)
*   **Country:** (e.g., USA, Canada, UK)
*   **Education Level:** (e.g., High School, Bachelor's, Master's)
*   **Product Category:** (e.g., electronics, clothing, books)
*   **Gender:** (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary)

Categorical variables are fundamental in data analysis and machine learning. Understanding them is crucial because how you handle them significantly impacts your models and insights. The next sections will explore different types of categorical variables and how to effectively work with them.

## Types of Categorical Variables

Categorical variables can be further divided into different types based on the nature of the categories. The most common types are nominal and ordinal variables.

### Nominal Variables

**Nominal variables** represent categories with no inherent order or ranking.  The categories are distinct and mutually exclusive, but there's no sense of one category being "greater than" or "less than" another. They are simply different groups.

**Characteristics of Nominal Variables:**

*   **No Order:** Categories cannot be meaningfully ordered.
*   **Distinct Categories:** Each category is unique and separate from others.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Colors:** Red, Blue, Green. There's no inherent order to colors. Red isn't "higher" or "lower" than blue.
    *   **Types of Fruits:** Apple, Banana, Orange.  Again, no inherent ranking.
    *   **Countries:** USA, Canada, UK. Countries are distinct categories without a natural order.
    *   **Gender (in some contexts):** Male, Female, Non-binary. While societal biases might exist, gender categories themselves are nominal in a statistical sense (though this is a complex and sensitive topic).
    *   **Types of Animals:** Dog, Cat, Bird.

**In summary, nominal variables are about distinct groups without any implied order or hierarchy.** When working with nominal variables in machine learning, it's important to use encoding techniques that respect this lack of order, such as one-hot encoding (which we'll discuss later).

### Ordinal Variables

**Ordinal variables** are categorical variables where the categories have a meaningful order or rank. Unlike nominal variables, the order of categories matters. However, the intervals between categories are not necessarily uniform or meaningful.

**Characteristics of Ordinal Variables:**

*   **Ordered Categories:** Categories can be ranked or ordered.
*   **Unequal Intervals:** The difference between categories is not necessarily consistent or quantifiable.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Education Level:**  Elementary School < High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD. There's a clear order of educational attainment.
    *   **Customer Satisfaction Ratings:** Very Dissatisfied < Dissatisfied < Neutral < Satisfied < Very Satisfied.  These ratings have a clear order from negative to positive.
    *   **Shirt Size:** Small < Medium < Large < Extra Large. Sizes have an order, but the difference in actual size between Small and Medium might not be the same as between Large and Extra Large.
    *   **Movie Ratings (Stars):** 1 star < 2 stars < 3 stars < 4 stars < 5 stars. Star ratings indicate increasing levels of appreciation.
    *   **Likert Scales (e.g., Agreement Level):** Strongly Disagree < Disagree < Neutral < Agree < Strongly Agree. These scales represent ordered levels of agreement.

**Key takeaway: Ordinal variables have a sense of order, but the "distance" between categories isn't precisely measurable.** When encoding ordinal variables, techniques like ordinal encoding are often appropriate because they can preserve the inherent order.

### Interval and Ratio Variables (Briefly, for completeness)

**Interval and ratio variables** are primarily **numerical**, representing quantities with meaningful intervals. However, it's worth briefly mentioning them here for completeness and to clarify their distinction from categorical variables.

*   **Interval Variables:** Have ordered categories with meaningful and equal intervals between them, but no true zero point.  Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit is a classic example. A 10-degree difference is the same anywhere on the scale, but 0 degrees doesn't mean "no temperature."
*   **Ratio Variables:**  Similar to interval variables, but they have a true zero point, indicating the absence of the quantity being measured. Examples include height, weight, age, and income. Zero height means no height, zero income means no income.

**Why mention them here?**

While interval and ratio variables are numerical, in some specific contexts, they might be *categorized* or *binned* for certain analyses or modeling techniques. For example:

*   **Age groups:**  Instead of using age as a continuous ratio variable, you might categorize it into age groups (e.g., 0-18, 19-35, 36-55, 56+). In this case, age groups become ordinal categorical variables.
*   **Income brackets:**  Similar to age, income can be categorized into brackets (e.g., low, medium, high income).

**However, in most machine learning scenarios, interval and ratio variables are treated as numerical variables directly.**  The encoding techniques we'll discuss next are primarily for nominal and ordinal categorical variables.

## Encoding Techniques for Categorical Variables

Categorical variables, especially nominal and ordinal ones, cannot be directly used in most machine learning algorithms. They need to be converted into a numerical format. This process is called **categorical encoding**. Let's explore some common techniques:

### Ordinal Encoding

**Ordinal encoding** is used for **ordinal categorical variables**. It replaces each category with a numerical value based on its order. The numerical values typically range from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of unique categories. The order of these numbers reflects the inherent order of the categories.

**Key points about Ordinal Encoding:**

*   **Preserves Order:**  Crucially, it maintains the order of ordinal categories.
*   **Suitable for Ordinal Data:**  Well-suited for variables where order is meaningful (e.g., education level, satisfaction ratings).
*   **Example:**
    *   Consider "Education Level":  Elementary School, High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD.
    *   Ordinal Encoding might map them as:
        *   Elementary School: 0
        *   High School: 1
        *   Bachelor's: 2
        *   Master's: 3
        *   PhD: 4

*   **Practical Example:**  As seen in the [`categorical variables.md`](./categorical variables.md) file, scikit-learn's `OrdinalEncoder` can be used to implement this.

**When to use Ordinal Encoding:**

*   When dealing with ordinal categorical variables.
*   When the number of categories is relatively small.
*   When you want to preserve the order information in your data.

**Limitations:**

*   Not suitable for nominal categorical variables because it implies an order that doesn't exist.
*   The numerical values assigned are arbitrary; the intervals between them are not meaningful.
