# Understanding Categorical Variables

## What are Categorical Variables?

[Explain what categorical variables are. Define them and contrast with numerical variables.]

## Types of Categorical Variables

### Nominal Variables

[Explain nominal variables with examples. e.g., colors, types of fruits]

### Ordinal Variables

[Explain ordinal variables with examples. e.g., education level, customer satisfaction ratings]

### Interval and Ratio Variables (Briefly, for completeness)

[Briefly explain interval and ratio variables and why they are generally considered numerical, but can sometimes be treated categorically.]

## Encoding Techniques for Categorical Variables

### Ordinal Encoding

[Briefly describe ordinal encoding, referencing the practical example in `categorical variables.md`.]

### One-Hot Encoding

[Explain one-hot encoding in detail with examples. Discuss when to use it and its advantages/disadvantages.]

### Label Encoding

[Explain label encoding in detail with examples. Discuss when to use it and its advantages/disadvantages.]

### Target Encoding

[Briefly introduce target encoding as a more advanced technique. Mention when it might be useful.]

## Conclusion

[Summarize the importance of understanding categorical variables and choosing appropriate encoding techniques.]
