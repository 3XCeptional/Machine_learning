# Here is a step-by-step guide on how to implement machine learning, a recommendation system, and data science into your final year project "Streamflix."

### 1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**

**Step 1.1: Gather User Interaction Data**

- **User data:** Collect information like user viewing history, session duration, ratings, clicks, and search queries. Ensure this data is stored in your Postgres database.
- **Content metadata:** Gather data about the content (e.g., genre, cast, description, release date) which will be essential for content-based filtering.

**Step 1.2: Preprocessing**

- **Handle missing values:** Use techniques like mean imputation or removal of incomplete data points (via Pandas).

    ```python
    df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)
    ```

- **Encoding categorical variables:** Use one-hot encoding or label encoding for categorical data such as genres, cast, etc.

    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
    encoder = LabelEncoder()
    df['encoded_column'] = encoder.fit_transform(df['category'])
    ```

- **Normalization/Scaling:** Standardize the numerical features like ratings and session durations to avoid bias in machine learning models.

    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    df['scaled_feature'] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['feature']])
    ```

### 2. **Model Selection**

**Step 2.1: Choose Suitable Algorithms for Recommendations**

- **Collaborative Filtering:**
  - **User-based filtering:** Recommends content based on similar users.
  - **Item-based filtering:** Recommends items that are similar to what the user has already watched.

- **Content-Based Filtering:**
  - Uses content features (genres, actors) to recommend similar content to what the user has liked before.

- **Matrix Factorization:**
  - Techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can break down the interaction matrix (users vs items) and find hidden patterns for recommendations.

    ```python
    from surprise import SVD
    from surprise import Dataset, Reader
    reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 5))
    data = Dataset.load_from_df(df[['userId', 'movieId', 'rating']], reader)
    trainset = data.build_full_trainset()
    model = SVD()
    model.fit(trainset)
    ```

### 3. **Model Training and Evaluation**

**Step 3.1: Train Recommendation Models**

- Use Python libraries such as **Surprise**, **Scikit-learn**, or **TensorFlow**.

    ```python
    from surprise.model_selection import cross_validate
    cross_validate(model, data, measures=['RMSE', 'MAE'], cv=5, verbose=True)
    ```

**Step 3.2: Evaluation Metrics**

- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** are common metrics for evaluating the accuracy of recommendation systems.

    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    rmse = mean_squared_error(true_ratings, predicted_ratings, squared=False)
    ```

### 4. **Integration with Django**

**Step 4.1: Model Integration**

- Save the trained model using libraries like `joblib` or `pickle`.

    ```python
    import joblib
    joblib.dump(model, 'recommendation_model.pkl')
    ```

**Step 4.2: Serve Recommendations via Django**

- Load the trained model in Django views or APIs:

    ```python
    model = joblib.load('recommendation_model.pkl')
    user_data = get_user_data(user_id)
    recommendations = model.predict(user_data)
    ```

- Update views to return recommendations alongside regular content feeds. You may need to create API endpoints that serve personalized content for each user.

**Step 4.3: Recommendation System in Django**

- Integrate recommendations into user-specific views by querying the model and returning personalized suggestions.

    ```python
    def get_recommendations(user):
        model = joblib.load('recommendation_model.pkl')
        recommendations = model.predict(user_data)
        return render(request, 'recommendations.html', {'recommendations': recommendations})
    ```

### 5. **Data Analytics**

**Step 5.1: Analyze User Data**

- Use **Pandas** for exploring data, generating reports on user activity, and tracking trends.

    ```python
    user_df.groupby('user_id')['session_duration'].mean().plot(kind='bar')
    ```

**Step 5.2: Insights for Platform Optimization**

- Use **Pythonâ€™s Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** libraries to visualize data patterns like peak user activity times, popular genres, or content that leads to longer engagement.

**Step 5.3: Data-Driven Decisions**

- Use insights to adjust content offerings, promotional strategies, or improve user experience by introducing features like personalized push notifications.

### 6. **Performance Optimization**

**Step 6.1: Optimize Database Queries**

- Use indexing and query optimization techniques in Postgres to enhance data retrieval times.

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_user_history ON user_activity (user_id);
    ```

- Analyze slow queries using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in Postgres and refactor queries accordingly.

**Step 6.2: Cache Frequently Accessed Data**

- Implement caching with **Redis** or **Memcached** to reduce query load on the database.

**Step 6.3: Asynchronous Processing**

- Utilize **Celery** to handle tasks like user analytics, content recommendations, and video transcoding in the background.
