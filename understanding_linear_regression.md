# Understanding Linear Regression: A Deep Dive

## What is Linear Regression?

[Explain Linear Regression in detail, expanding on the basic definition from "What are the 10 Popular Machine Learning Algorithms?" file.]

## Types of Linear Regression

### Simple Linear Regression

[Explain Simple Linear Regression with examples and mathematical formulation.]

### Multiple Linear Regression

[Explain Multiple Linear Regression with examples and mathematical formulation.]

### Polynomial Regression

[Explain Polynomial Regression and when it's used.]

## Assumptions of Linear Regression

[Discuss the key assumptions of linear regression (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals, no multicollinearity) and why they are important.]

## Evaluation Metrics for Linear Regression

[Explain common evaluation metrics for regression models, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared.]

## Implementation and Examples

[Provide Python code examples using scikit-learn to implement Linear Regression. Potentially link to or incorporate content from `Supervised_vs_Unsupervised/supervised/linear regression.md`.]

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Linear Regression

[Summarize the pros and cons of using Linear Regression.]

## Conclusion
