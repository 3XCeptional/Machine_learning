# Understanding Logistic Regression: A Deep Dive

## What is Logistic Regression?

[Explain Logistic Regression in detail, expanding on the basic definition from "What are the 10 Popular Machine Learning Algorithms?" file.]

## The Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function)

[Explain the logistic/sigmoid function, its mathematical formula, and its role in logistic regression for probability estimation.]

## Types of Logistic Regression

### Binary Logistic Regression

[Explain Binary Logistic Regression for binary classification problems.]

### Multinomial Logistic Regression

[Explain Multinomial Logistic Regression for multi-class classification problems.]

### Ordinal Logistic Regression

[Briefly explain Ordinal Logistic Regression for ordinal classification problems.]

## Cost Function: Log Loss (Cross-Entropy)

[Explain the Log Loss (Cross-Entropy) cost function used in logistic regression and why it's suitable for classification.]

## Optimization Algorithms

[Briefly discuss optimization algorithms used to minimize the cost function, such as Gradient Descent and Newton's method.]

## Regularization in Logistic Regression

[Explain regularization techniques (L1, L2) used in logistic regression to prevent overfitting.]

## Evaluation Metrics for Logistic Regression

[Explain common evaluation metrics for classification models, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Confusion Matrix.]

## Assumptions of Logistic Regression

[Discuss the key assumptions of logistic regression (linearity of log-odds, independence of errors, no multicollinearity, sufficient sample size) and their importance.]

## Implementation and Examples

[Provide Python code examples using scikit-learn to implement Logistic Regression. Potentially link to or incorporate content from `Supervised_vs_Unsupervised/supervised/logistic_regression.md`.]

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Logistic Regression

[Summarize the pros and cons of using Logistic Regression.]

## Conclusion

[Conclude with the importance and applications of Logistic Regression.]
