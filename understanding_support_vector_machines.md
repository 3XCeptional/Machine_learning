# Understanding Support Vector Machines (SVM): A Deep Dive

## What are Support Vector Machines (SVM)?

[Explain Support Vector Machines (SVM) in detail, expanding on the basic definition from "What are the 10 Popular Machine Learning Algorithms?" file.]

## Support Vectors and Margin Maximization

[Explain the concept of Support Vectors and Margin Maximization, which are central to SVM.]

## Kernels in SVM

[Explain the concept of Kernels and discuss different types of kernels:]

### Linear Kernel

[Explain Linear Kernel and when it's appropriate.]

### Polynomial Kernel

[Explain Polynomial Kernel and its use cases.]

### Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel

[Explain RBF Kernel, its properties, and when to use it.]

### Sigmoid Kernel

[Explain Sigmoid Kernel and its relation to neural networks.]

## Mathematical Formulation of SVM

[Briefly touch upon the mathematical formulation of SVM, including the Primal and Dual problems and Lagrangian multipliers (optional: keep it high-level or provide more detail if appropriate).]

## Soft Margin SVM and the C Parameter

[Explain Soft Margin SVM, which handles non-separable data, and the role of the C parameter in controlling the trade-off between margin maximization and misclassification errors.]

## Support Vector Regression (SVR)

[Briefly introduce Support Vector Regression (SVR) and how SVM can be used for regression tasks.]

## Advantages and Disadvantages of SVM

[Summarize the pros and cons of using Support Vector Machines.]

## Implementation and Examples

[Provide Python code examples using scikit-learn to implement SVM for classification and regression. Potentially link to or incorporate content from `Supervised_vs_Unsupervised/supervised/support_vector_machines.md`.]

## Conclusion

[Conclude with the importance and applications of Support Vector Machines.]
