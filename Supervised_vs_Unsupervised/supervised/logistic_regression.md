# Logistic Regression

**What is it?**

Logistic Regression is like a superhero for binary classification problems!  Imagine you're trying to decide if an email is spam or not spam. Logistic Regression helps you make that decision. It's a simple and effective way to predict yes/no outcomes.

**Simple Example:**

Let's say we want to predict if a student will pass an exam based on the number of hours they studied.  We can use Logistic Regression to build a model that, given the study hours, tells us the probability of passing (or not passing).

**Code Snippet (Python with scikit-learn):**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Sample data (hours studied, pass/fail)
X = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]
y = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] # 0 = fail, 1 = pass

# Train the Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict if a student studying for 3.5 hours will pass
prediction = model.predict([[3.5]])
print(f"Will the student pass? (1=Yes, 0=No): {prediction[0]}")
```
