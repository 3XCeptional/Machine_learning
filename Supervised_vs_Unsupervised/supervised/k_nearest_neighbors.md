# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?**

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the simplest yet surprisingly effective machine learning algorithms. It's all about **learning from your neighbors**!  Imagine you're trying to classify a new data point. KNN looks at the 'K' closest data points (neighbors) that are already labeled and makes a decision based on the majority class among those neighbors.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

*   **Lazy Learning:** KNN is a "lazy learner" because it doesn't learn a model explicitly during training. Instead, it memorizes the training data and uses it directly during prediction.
*   **Distance Metric:**  "Closest" is defined by a distance metric, like Euclidean distance (straight-line distance) or Manhattan distance (city block distance). The choice of metric can impact performance.
*   **Choosing K:** The 'K' in KNN is crucial. It's the number of neighbors you consider.
    *   **Small K (e.g., K=1):** Can be sensitive to noise and outliers in the data.
    *   **Large K:**  Can smooth out noise but might miss local patterns. Choosing the right K often involves experimentation.

KNN is intuitive and versatile, working for both classification and regression tasks. It's particularly useful when decision boundaries are irregular and complex.

**Simple Example: Movie Recommendation**

Imagine you're building a movie recommendation system. KNN can help suggest movies a user might like based on the preferences of similar users!

Let's say we have data on users and their movie ratings.  For a new user, we want to recommend movies. KNN can work like this:

1.  **Find similar users:**  We use KNN to find the 'K' users who are most similar to the new user based on their movie ratings. Similarity can be measured by distance metrics on user-rating vectors.
2.  **Aggregate neighbors' preferences:** Look at the movies those 'K' nearest neighbors have liked (rated highly).
3.  **Recommend top movies:** Recommend the movies that are popular among the neighbors but haven't been seen by the new user yet.

For instance, if you like action and sci-fi movies, KNN would find other users with similar taste profiles and recommend movies that those users have enjoyed, but you haven't watched yet.

This example illustrates how KNN can be used for recommendation systems by finding similar entities (users in this case) and leveraging their preferences to make predictions for a new entity.

**Code Snippet (Python with scikit-learn):**

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Sample data (features, label)
X = [[2, 2], [3, 2], [1, 4], [5, 6], [6, 5], [4, 4]]
y = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] # 0 = class 1, 1 = class 2

# Train the KNN classifier
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3) # You can choose the number of neighbors
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict the class for a new data point [3.5, 4]
prediction = model.predict([[3.5, 4]])
print(f"Predicted class: {prediction[0]}")
```
