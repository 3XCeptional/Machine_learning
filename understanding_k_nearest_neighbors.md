# Understanding K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A Deep Dive

## What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?

[Explain K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in detail, expanding on the basic definition from "What are the 10 Popular Machine Learning Algorithms?" file.]

## How KNN Algorithm Works

### KNN for Classification

[Explain how KNN works for classification tasks, including the majority voting process.]

### KNN for Regression

[Explain how KNN works for regression tasks, including averaging or weighted averaging of neighbors' values.]

## Distance Metrics in KNN

[Discuss different distance metrics used in KNN and when to use each:]

### Euclidean Distance

[Explain Euclidean Distance and its formula.]

### Manhattan Distance

[Explain Manhattan Distance and its formula.]

### Minkowski Distance

[Explain Minkowski Distance as a generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distances.]

### Other Distance Metrics (Briefly mention if relevant, e.g., Hamming, Cosine)

## Choosing the Right K Value

[Explain the importance of choosing the right K value and its impact on bias and variance. Discuss methods for selecting optimal K:]

### Cross-Validation

[Explain how cross-validation can be used to find the optimal K.]

### Elbow Method (for visualization)

[Explain the Elbow Method as a visual aid for choosing K.]

## Weighted KNN

[Explain the concept of Weighted KNN and how it can improve performance by weighting neighbors based on distance.]

## KD-Tree and Ball-Tree for Efficient Neighbor Search

[Briefly introduce KD-Tree and Ball-Tree data structures and how they speed up neighbor search in KNN.]

## Advantages and Disadvantages of KNN

[Summarize the pros and cons of using K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.]

## Implementation and Examples

[Provide Python code examples using scikit-learn to implement KNN for classification and regression. Potentially link to or incorporate content from `Supervised_vs_Unsupervised/supervised/k_nearest_neighbors.md`.]
